About 2 years of IoT-based smart parking lot usage data collected on ThingSpeak from a system of IR sensor and ESP32 board, which has the slot availability information with respect to timestamps. The dataset can be used for time-series prediction tasks. This dataset is available on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suwesh/iot-based-smart-parking-system-dataset) and [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/suwesh/IoT-based-SmartParkingSystem-dataset).
