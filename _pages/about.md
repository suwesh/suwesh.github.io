I'm a Computer Science and Engineering graduate from National Institute of Technology Rourkela, with a strong focus on building intelligent and autonomous systems and data engineering solutions. At Hero Housing Finance, I work on developing cloud-based AI applications and automation solutions, including projects such as building a post-call analytics pipeline, implementation of test automation framework for Salesforce Org, and development of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline–based LLM application. 

My Bachelor Thesis implemented a Computer Vision project for Autonomous Driving and proposed an architecture to enable hardware-level parallelism for parallel perception of the environment from multiple sensor data, hence leading to quicker scene understanding and decision making ability for high speed autonomous systems. 

I have experience in cloud computing and building data solutions on Microsoft Azure. During my internship at TVS Motor Company, I built ETL pipelines and automated manual data processing using Azure Data Factory and Azure Databricks. 

My expertise spans Machine Learning, Deep Learning, High-Performance Computing, with hands-on work using Hugging Face open-source models deployed on local GPUs and cloud platforms like AWS.
