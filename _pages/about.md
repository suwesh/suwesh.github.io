I'm a Computer Science and Engineering graduate from National Institute of Technology Rourkela, with a strong focus on building intelligent and autonomous systems and data engineering solutions. At Hero Housing Finance, I develop AI/ML and automation solutions on AWS, working on projects such as building a post-call analytics pipeline, implementation of test automation workflows for desktop and mobile applications, and development of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelineâ€“based LLM application. 

My Bachelor Thesis implemented a Computer Vision project for Autonomous Driving and proposed an architecture to enable hardware-level parallelism for parallel perception of the environment from multiple sensor data, hence leading to quicker scene understanding and decision making ability for high speed autonomous systems. 

I have experience in cloud computing and building data solutions on Microsoft Azure. During my internship at TVS Motor Company, I built ETL pipelines and automated manual data processing using Azure Data Factory and Azure Databricks. 

Currently working in Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Science.
